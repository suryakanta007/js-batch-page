  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Question**                        **Answer**

  Will sessions be recorded?          This founding cohort is 100% live.
                                      We may add recordings in future
                                      batches, but for now, show up or
                                      miss out.

  I\'m a complete beginner. Will I    Yes! We start from zero. No prior
  keep up?                            coding experience needed.

  Why should I join the first batch?  Lowest price ever (₹899 vs ₹1,999
                                      later), smaller batch = more
                                      attention, lifetime community
                                      access.

  What if I can\'t attend a session?  All project files and code will be
                                      shared. You can catch up, but
                                      attendance is highly recommended.

  Is there a refund policy?           Yes! Full refund within the first
                                      week if you\'re not satisfied.
